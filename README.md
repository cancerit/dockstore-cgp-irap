This project wraps iRAP into a Dockstore tool.

Required inputs are:

1. reference: A FastA file of the reference genome to map reads to. The file can be gzipped.
1. gtf: Reference gene annotation in GTF format. The file can be gzipped. It can be a tar file of GTF gene reference files genereated by previous iRAP runs.
1. species: species name, can be any string as well, this might be recorded in output file names and bam headers.
1. raw_read_file(s): raw read files, can be FastQ(s) or BAM(s). Theie relations to samples will need to be set in either configuration files or using `irap_conf_string`.
1. config and/or irap_conf_string(s): `config` should be a file with analysis configurations for iRAP. Details are in [iRAP wiki](https://github.com/nunofonseca/irap/wiki/8-Configuration-file). These parameters can be supplied with `irap_conf_string` as well. When same parameter is set in both the configuration file and with `irap_conf_string`, the one in configuration file will be overwritten.

Optional inputs are:
1. exp_name - experiment name to distinguish your analysis, output folder will have the same name.
1. conta_genomes: FastA format of genomes to filter raw reads. If supplied, iRAP will remove reads that can be mapped to these genomes from raw reads.


Release process
===============
This project is maintained using HubFlow.

1. Make appropriate changes
2. Bump version in `Dockerfile` and `Dockstore.cwl`
3. Push changes
4. Check state on Travis
5. Generate the release (add notes to GitHub)
6. Confirm that image has been built on [quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/wtsicgp/dockstore-cgp-irap?tab=builds)
7. Update the [dockstore](https://dockstore.org/containers/quay.io/wtsicgp/dockstore-cgp-irap) entry, see [their docs](https://dockstore.org/docs/getting-started-with-dockstore).
